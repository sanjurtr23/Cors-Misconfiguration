Start Burp Suite and configure your browser to use Burp as a proxy.
Navigate to the web application you want to test.
In Burp, go to the "Proxy" tab and make sure that intercept is turned on.
In your browser, perform an action that triggers a CORS request, such as submitting a form or loading a resource from a different domain.
When the request is intercepted by Burp, forward it to the server and observe the response in the "Proxy" or "Repeater" tabs.
Analyze the response for any unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities, such as access control issues, unauthorized data disclosure, or injection attacks.
If the response includes a URL parameter that may be vulnerable to SSRF, modify the parameter value to point to a different domain or IP address that you control.
Forward the request to the server and observe the response in the "Proxy" or "Repeater" tabs.
Analyze the response for any signs of SSRF, such as unexpected requests to external resources or responses containing sensitive information.
If SSRF is confirmed, you can modify the request further to perform more advanced attacks, such as port scanning, network reconnaissance, or remote code execution.
