Start Burp Suite and configure your browser to use Burp as a proxy.
Navigate to the web application you want to test.
In Burp, go to the "Proxy" tab and make sure that intercept is turned on.
In your browser, perform an action that triggers a CORS request, such as submitting a form or loading a resource from a different domain.
When the request is intercepted by Burp, forward it to the server and observe the response in the "Proxy" or "Repeater" tabs.
Analyze the response for any unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities, such as access control issues, unauthorized data disclosure, or injection attacks.
If the response includes a URL parameter or header that may be vulnerable to CSRF, modify the parameter value to include a CSRF payload that can be executed in the user's browser.
Forward the request to the server and observe the response in the "Proxy" or "Repeater" tabs.
Analyze the response for any signs of CSRF, such as unexpected requests to the web application or unauthorized data manipulation.
If CSRF is confirmed, you can modify the payload to perform more advanced attacks, such as stealing sensitive data, hijacking user sessions, or performing unauthorized actions.
